# Additional Notes from Chat GPT,
# In the refactored code:

# The constructor method is replaced with the __init__ method, which is the standard initializer in Python.
# The comparison operator == is used instead of == and =! for assignments in the constructor.
# The selfish parameter in getShippingPrice(selfish) is renamed to self to follow the common convention in Python.
# The = operator is used instead of = in the elif condition for selfish.type = 'Cargo'.
# The code is properly indented to maintain the correct structure.
# Now the code should be free of syntax errors.
