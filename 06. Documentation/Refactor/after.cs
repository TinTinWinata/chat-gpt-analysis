// ChatGPT Explanation:

// We encapsulated the money field by making it private. This ensures that it can only be accessed through the getter method.
// We added a getter method getMoney() to provide read-only access to the money field. This allows other classes to retrieve the current balance of the account.
// In the withdraw method, we directly subtract the amount from the money field. This eliminates the need for the temp variable and simplifies the code.
// By applying these changes, we have removed the Self Encapsulation Field smell and improved the code by adhering to encapsulation principles.
